# EVERY LIFE TASKS

The code includes comments which explain why I did some things and what I could have done instead.
Of course they don't justify or explain everything so I would be more than happy to explain my decisions and discuss alternatives.

- Important Libraries Used

    -Retrofit
        
    -Mockito
    
    -Dagger2 - Hilt


- Architecture

    -MVVM
    

- Unit Testing

    -I haven't covered all edge cases for any of the tests. If this was a real project I would most probably do a lot more Unit & UI Testing
    
    -Some of my Unit Tests are part of the androidTest package as I could not use Hilt in the /Test package
        
    -I have tried to use multiple methods/libraries(mockito, roboelectric, junit, espresso etc) to showcase my experience. Although I am 
    not sure if that was the right decision for the project as using multiple technologies might make the UI and Unit Tests a bit less readable
